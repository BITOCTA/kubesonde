# Kubesonde frontend

This project contains the UI modules to display and manipulate the graph generated by Kubesonde. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before running the scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `nvm use`
Is needed to select the exact version of node compatible with the application. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `CI=true npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## TODOs:
- At times pods appear multiple times in the UI.
- UI is slow when there are several objects to display
- There seems to be some issue with the error edges. Investigate further
- Export should match the current displayed content
- Code should be refactored deeply.
